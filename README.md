## Welcome to my Github!

I am a former Talent Professional who transitioned into Software Engineering.
I was formally a Software Engineer for a Chatbot platform, [Navbot](http://navbot.io) and a Frontend Developer for [Ondot/Fiserv](https://www.ondotsystems.com) creating a web app version of their Card App. I was also a Software Engineer for two Fintech starups, [Equal Future](https://equalfuture.com) and [Blue Sky Financial](https://blueskyfinancial.com/).

I am passionate about building web applications with scalable web technologies particularly with Javascript Web Frameworks such as React.
I am recognized as a team player for having an empathetic approach as well as a champion of a growth mindset.

I am currently working on [HeadxHunt](https://headxhunt.com), a searchable directory for Recruitment Agencies and Consultants
